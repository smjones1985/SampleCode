    <h3>A Mission Statement of sorts:</h3>
       	<p class="pabout">Modern motorcyles have never appealed to me as much as the ones from my youth. When I began putting together motorcyles, I wanted to harken back to a vintage design age while maintaining a sleek style.</p>
	<h3>A little about me:</h3>
    <p class="pabout">My name is Tom Jones. I was born in California and raised in Arkansas. My whole life I've had a desire to create, build, and design various projects. I have a wonderful wife, four kids, and two grandchildren (with a third on the way!). We currently reside in Amelia, VA.</p>
  	<h3>Accolades:</h3>
    <p class="pabout">Award for best design in 2008 from such and such</p>
